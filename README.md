⚠️ **Early Development** ⚠️

Please note that Sonder is currently in very early stages of development. The
project is not yet functional and many features are still being planned or
implemented. We appreciate your interest, but be aware that:

- The codebase is subject to frequent and significant changes
- Many features listed above are not yet implemented
- The project structure and architecture may undergo major revisions
